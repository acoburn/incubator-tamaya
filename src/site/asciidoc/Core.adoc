[[Core]]
== Tamaya Core Implementation
=== Overview

Tamaya Core provides an implementation of the link:API.html[Tamaya Configuration API] and adds additional functionality
and building blocks for supporting SPI implementations.

Tamaya Core contains the following artifacts:

* Implementations of +Configuration, ConfigurationContext, ConfigurationContextBuilder+ ConfigurationProviderSpi+
* A +java.util.ServiceLoader+ based +ServiceContext+ implementation. Hereby it implements component priorization based
  on the +@Priority+ annotations.
* A PropertyConverterManager+ that loads and stores references to all the preconfigured +PropertyConverter+ instances
hereby providing type conversion for all important types.
* A simple default configuration setup using the current classpath and an optional staging variable.
* It collects all +PropertySource+ and +PropertySourceProvider+ instances registered with the +ServiceLoader+ and
  registers them in the global +ConfigurationContext+
* It provides a +ConfigurationContextBuilder+ implementation (class +DefaultConfigurationContextBuilder+) and allows
  changing the current +ConfigurationContext+.

The overall size of the library is very small. All required components are implemented and registered, so basically the
Core module is a complete configuration solution. Nevertheless it is also very minimalistic, but fortunately is flexible
enough to be extended/accommodated with additional features as needed, such as

* placeholder and resolution mechanisms
* dynamic resource path lookup, e.g. with ant styled patterns
* configuration injection and configuration templates
* abstraction for reusable formats
* integration with other existing solutions
* configuration and configuration isolation targeting Java EE
* dynamic configuration and configuration updates
* Configuration management extensions
* remote configuration
* and more

For details about the extension modules available and  their functionality refer to the link:modules.html[extension user guide].


[[CorePropertyConverters]]

|=======


=== Registering PropertyConverters

Additional +PropertyConverters+ can be implemented easily. It is recommended to register then using the +java.util.ServiceLoader+,
meaning you add a file under +META-INF/service/org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertyConverter+ containing the fully qualified
class names of the converters to be registered (one line per each).

Alternatively you can also use a +ConfigurationContextBuilder+ to add additional converters programmatically.

NOTE: API Implementations can be read-only thus not allowing adding additional converters programmatically.


[[ComponentLoadingAndPriorization]]
=== Component Loading and Priorization

Tamaya Core in general loads all components using the +java.util.ServiceLoader+ mechanism. This means that new components
must be registered by adding a file under +META-INF/service/<myInterfaceName>+ containing the fully qualified
implementation class names of the components to be registered (one line per each).
The +ServiceLoader+ itself does not provide any functionality for overriding or ordering of components. Tamaya
core adds this functionality by the possibility to add +@Priority+ annotations to the components registered.
By default, and if no annotation is added +0+ is used as priority. Hereby higher values preceed lower values, meaning

* if a singleton component is accessed from the current +ServiceContext+ the component with the higher value
  effectively _overrides/replaces_ any component with lower values.
* if a collection of components is obtained from the +ServiceContext+ the components are ordered in order, where the
  ones with higher priority are before components with lower priority.
* if priorities match Tamaya Core additionally sorts them using the simple class name. This ensures that ordering is
  still defined and predictable in almost all scenarios.

NOTE: Sorting the property sources based on their ordinal value is only the default ordering principle applied. By implementing
      your own implementation of +ConfigurationProviderSpi+ you can apply a different logic:


[[RegisteringPropertySources]]
=== Registering Property Sources

PropertySources that provide configuration properties are registered as ordinary components as described in the previous
section. Nevertheless the priority is not managed based on +@Priority+ annotations, but based on an explicit
+int getOrdinal()+ method. This allows to define the ordinal/priority of a +PropertySource+ explicitly. This is useful
due to several reasons:

* it allows to define the ordinal as part of the configuration, thus allowing new overriding property sources being
  added easily.
* it allows to define the ordinal dynamically, e.g. based on the configuration location, the time of loading or
  whatever may be appropriate.


[[CorePropertySources]]
== Configuration Setup in Core

Tamaya Core provides a minimal configuration setting, that allows you to configure SE
applications already easily. Basically configuration is built  up by default as follows:

. Read environment properties and add them prefixed with +env.+
. Read all files found at +META-INF/javaconfiguration.properties+
  and +META-INF/javaconfiguration.xml+


=== Overview of Registered Default Property Sources and Providers

The Tamaya Core implementation provides a couple of default +PropertySource+ implementations, which are automatically
registered. They are all in the package +org.apache.tamaya.core.propertysource+ and
+org.apache.tamaya.core.provider+:

[width="100%",frame="1",options="header",grid="all"]
|=======
|_Type_                                   |_Class Name_                   |_Ordinal Used_
|META-INF/javaconfiguration.properties    |JavaConfigurationProvider      |0
|META-INF/javaconfiguration.xml           |JavaConfigurationProvider      |0
|Environment Properties                   |EnvironmentPropertySource      |300
|System Properties                        |SystemPropertySource           |400
|=======


=== Abstract Class PropertiesFilePropertySource

The abstract class +PropertiesFilePropertySource+ can be used for implementing a +PropertySource+ based on a +URL+
instance that points to a +.properites+ file. It requires a +URL+ to be passed on the constructor:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
PropertiesFilePropertySource(URL url);
--------------------------------------------


==== Abstract Class PropertiesPropertySource

The abstract class +PropertiesPropertySource+ can be used for implementing a +PropertySource+ based on a +Properties+
instance. It requires a +PropertySource+ to be passed on the constructor:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
PropertiesPropertySource(Properties properties);
--------------------------------------------


==== Abstract Class BasePropertySource

The abstract class +BasePropertySource+ can be used for implementing custom +PropertySource+ classes. It requires only
one method to implemented:

[source,java]
.Implementing a PropertySource using BasePropertySource
--------------------------------------------
public class MyPropertySource extends BasePropertySource{

    public String getName(){
        // return a unique name for the property source, e.g. based on the underlying resource. This name also
        // allows to access the property source later
    }

    public Map<String, String> getProperties(){
        // Get a map with all properties provided by this property source
        // If the property source is not scannable, the map returned may be empty.
        // In the ladder case the +boolean isScannale()+ must be overridden, since
        // by default property sources are assumed to be scannable.
    }

}
--------------------------------------------

By default the ordinal of the property sources will be 1000, unless the key +tamaya.ordinal+ asdefined in
+PropertySource.TAMAYA_ORDINAL+ is present in the current +PropertySource+. Of course it is also possible to override
the inherited +protected void initializeOrdinal(final int defaultOrdinal)+, or directly +int getOrdinal()+.


[[CorePropertySourceProviders]]
=== Default PropertySourceProvider in Core

With +org.apache.tamaya.core.provider.JavaConfigurationProvider+ there is also a default +PropertySourceProvider+
present that loads all .properties files found at +META-INF/javaconfiguration.properties+
and +META-INF/javaconfiguration.xml+.


[[Extensions]]
== Adding Extensions

The Core module only implements the link:API.html[API]. Many users require/wish additional functionality from a
configuration system. Fortunately there are numerous extensions available that add further functionality.
Loading extensions hereby is trivial: you only are required to add the corresponding dependency to the classpath.

For detailed information on the extensions available refer to the link:extensions.html[extensions documentation].
